# IBM-Capstone-Project

This project is part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate course on coursera.org.
Here I will be using Pythonâ€™s data science toolkit to demonstrate the creation of value by applying
the learned skills. I will present a hypothetical business problem, discuss data and methodology
used to solve the problem, share the analysis results and provide recommendations.
